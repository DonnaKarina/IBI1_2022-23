It' really difficult for me to push the files to Github from my terminal. However, I found I can do this on the website and it is easier to do so.
I tried really hard, staring at my computer for 4 hours to solve the above problem. TAT
Today my new problem is that the code that counts childnodes cannot work. I asked for several friends for help but it just don't work.
In the future, I will learn more about computering and study harder.
